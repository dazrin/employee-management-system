## About
This is a command line interface application developed using nodeJS and mySQL that acts as a content management system for employee data. This application has functionality in place to allow a user to create, view, and update employees, roles, and departments for organizational purposes.

3. Type `node app` into the console to run the program

4. A list of options should populate your console.
 > Select an option to create and add an employee, a role, or a department to the database. You may also select an option to view the employees, roles, or departments that currently exist in the database. In addition, you may also choose to update an employee's role, or the department the employee belongs to.

Once you select an option, you may be asked to enter additional information into the program such as a name, or you may be asked to select an additional item from a list depending on what option you initially selected.
